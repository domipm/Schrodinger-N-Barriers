# Schrodinger-N-Barriers
Simulation of a quantum wave-packet travelling through multiple rectangular potential barriers. The objective of this simulation is to study the effect of the barriers on the transmission coefficient, which is calculated by measuring the wavefunction after crossing the potential barriers over a high number of identical experiments.
